# Testing checklists
In this repo there is an issue template for regression testing. By creating an issue using this template, testers have a checklist of specific tests to run. Issues should be created per environment.

The issue template is generated from the **AMAUAT Gap Analysis - Regression Testing Checklist** (stored in Artefactual Google Drive). To create a new issue template:

1. Export the checklist from Google Drive as a CSV
2. Load the CSV into OpenRefine
3. Apply changes/cleanup as needed
4. Export the data by going to Export > Templating
5. Paste data from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/sallain/5a7c54d256ab17eb04a202332594798e) into the template and export
6. Tidy up markdown file
